# Breast Cancer Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing **machine learning models** to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on various biomedical datasets.  
The goal was to compare multiple algorithms, evaluate their accuracy, and determine the most effective approach for early detection.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore and preprocess cancer-related datasets.
- Train and compare **classification models**.
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as **accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC**.
- Identify features most relevant to prediction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** – model training and evaluation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – data visualization

## 📊 Key Features
- Preprocessing steps including handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- Evaluation across multiple datasets for robustness.
- Comparison of **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM**, and other models.
- Visualization of feature importance and model performance.
